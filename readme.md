A collection of useful nodes to help with time based automation.  

Despite the large number of timer nodes available for node red i never found one i was satisfied with.  Some were far too simple and others way too complicated.  In the end i made my own which are indended to be reliable & easy to use with a clean design.

### Timer Node
Daily on/off timer node for that supports fixed times of the day or sun events.  Useful for setting timers such as lights that go on when its dark and off of at a fixed time.

### Time Check Node
Time check node for testing if a time (default current time) is within the set range including sun events. The original message is forwarded to different outputs based on pass/fail.

### Schedule Node
Set events for a weekly schedule using a visual calendar.  Useful for schedules such as heating where you have a morning time, evening time and these may vary at the weekend.

### Release Notes

<b>1.1.5</b>

- Added extra output for time check node to handle time not in range
- Optional input for time check node 'time' to check a fixed time value, rather than the current time.

<b>1.1.3</b>

- Previously sun events were calculated for the day they were scheduled and not the day they trigger resulting in small amount of error.

<b>1.1.2</b>

- Fixed bug in timer when using a negative offset.
- Limit random offset to 60 minutes.
- Handle case were no week days are selected in a timer.
